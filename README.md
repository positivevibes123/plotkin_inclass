A little about myself: I am a senior here at SUNY New Paltz. It is my last semester, but I am still undecided on whether I want to go for a graduate degree. I am 21 years old, turning 22 this semester. I have a younger brother who studies electrical engineering at Binghamton. I have a dog and a cat, named Chance and Clover, respectively.

I am studying for a B.A. in Computer Science. I have coded various personal projects here and there. This winter I was working on a task list website that used React.js as the frontend and Express.js for the backend, with Axios used for handling HTTP requests and a MySQL database for storing accounts. I struggled with getting authentication to work properly, but I want to go back and hopefully finish the project so I can show it working in full. It was a great learning experience despite the hurdles I had to overcome.

I enjoy frontend website development, but my true passion right now is with backend development. I have always enjoyed dealing with the more logical aspects in programming, rather than frontend design such as dealing with GUIs, etc.  I see myself using the knowledge of backend development in this course to aid me in the field of software engineering. During this semester I might design a portfolio site, in which case frontend design does become very helpful in that case so I am glad that I will still be learning both aspects of web development.
